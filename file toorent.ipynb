    "A step-by-step guide on how to create such a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up Google Drive API:\n",
    "    Go to the Google API Console.\n",
    "    Create a new project if you haven't already\n",
    "    Enable the Google Drive API for your project.\n",
    "    Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and download the client secret JSON file. This file will be used to authenticate with Google Drive.\n",
    "2.Install Necessary Libraries:\n",
    "You'll need to install some Python libraries to interact with the Google Drive API and to manage torrents. You can use pip to install them:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client pyrogram python-qbittorrent\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Authentication:\n",
    "    Use the client secret JSON file from the Google API Console to authenticate your application with Google Drive. Here's a simplified example of how to do it:\n",
    " from google.oauth2 import service_account\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the credentials\n",
    "credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(\n",
    "    'your-client-secret.json',\n",
    "    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']\n",
    ")\n",
    "4.Download Torrent:\n",
    "    You can use a torrent client library like python-qbittorrent to download torrents programmatically. Set up your torrent client with appropriate settings and download the torrent file.\n",
    "import qbittorrentapi\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the qBittorrent client\n",
    "client = qbittorrentapi.Client(host='localhost:8080', username='admin', password='adminadmin')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a torrent\n",
    "client.torrents_add(urls=['https://example.com/your.torrent'])\n",
    "5.Save to Google Drive:\n",
    "    Once you have the downloaded file, you can upload it to Google Drive using the Google Drive API. Here's an example:\n",
    "from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build the Google Drive service\n",
    "drive_service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Upload the file to Google Drive\n",
    "file_metadata = {\n",
    "    'name': 'My Torrent File',\n",
    "    'parents': ['your-parent-folder-id'],\n",
    "}\n",
    "media = MediaFileUpload('path/to/downloaded/file.torrent', mimetype='application/x-bittorrent')\n",
    "\n",
    "file = drive_service.files().create(\n",
    "    body=file_metadata,\n",
    "    media_body=media,\n",
    "    fields='id'\n",
    ").execute()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Error Handling and Cleanup:\n",
    "    Implement proper error handling and cleanup for your application, such as handling exceptions, deleting the downloaded torrent files, and managing Google Drive files if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Scheduling and Automation:\n",
    "    You can schedule the download and upload process using a task scheduler like cron (on Unix-like systems) or the Task Scheduler (on Windows) to make it automatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. This is a simplified outline of how you might structure your project. Be sure to refer to the official documentation of the libraries and services you're using for more detailed information and examples. Additionally, consider implementing rate limiting and error handling to ensure the stability and legality of your project.\n",
